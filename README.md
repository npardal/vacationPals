Welcome to VacationPals! This is a web application designed to connect people vacationing at the same resort, allowing them to make new friends, share experiences, and create lasting memories together. The application is built using React for the frontend and i'm currently building the backend - using Django, and it offers authentication using Google and other social logins for a seamless user experience.

## Introduction
VacationPals was developed with the aim of enhancing the vacation experience by fostering connections between people staying at the same resort. Often, people vacationing alone or with a small group may find it challenging to meet others and maximize their enjoyment. VacationPals solves this problem by providing a platform where users can find and connect with fellow vacationers, join groups and activities, and make the most out of their time at the resort.

## Features
User Authentication: VacationPals offers secure user authentication using Google and other popular social logins. This ensures a quick and hassle-free signup process.

Resort Search: Users can search for their resort by name or location and find other vacationers staying there.

User Profiles: Each user has a personalized profile where they can share information about themselves, their interests, and their vacation preferences.

Create and Join Groups: Users can create or join groups based on shared interests or activities they'd like to participate in during their stay.

Group Chat: Within each group, there is a dedicated chat room where members can communicate, plan activities, and coordinate meetups.

Activity Suggestions: The application offers personalized activity suggestions based on the user's interests and the resort's amenities.

Real-time Notifications: Users receive real-time notifications for group invitations, messages, and activity updates.

## Technologies Used
The following technologies were used to build VacationPals:

Frontend: React, Redux (for state management), React Router (for routing), and Material-UI (for styling).

Backend: Django, Django REST framework (for building APIs), and PostgreSQL (as the database).

Authentication: Firebase Authentication and OAuth 2.0 for Google and other social logins.

Real-time Communication: WebSockets or Socket.io for real-time group chat functionality.
